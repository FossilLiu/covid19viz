<p>COVID-19 updates for Thursday, April 9:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.co.shasta.ca.us/index/hhsa" target="_blank">Shasta County Health and Human Services:</a> The North State Federal Medical Station is making great progress. Processes are being developed and staffing is being secured.</p>
<p>We will be opening a four-bed crisis stabilization unit for people who are in our emergency departments with mental health conditions. This will free up our emergency rooms while still providing our mental health patients with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Shasta County Probation has taken on a leadership role in enforcing the stay-at-home order that requires non-essential businesses to be closed.</p>
<p>Isolation and quarantine both help protect the public by preventing exposure to people who have or may have a contagious disease. Isolation separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick. Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.</p>
<p>It’s very important to care for your mental health during this time of crisis, and we have some tips to help you do so. Visit www.shastaready.org and click on “Taking Care of Yourself.”</p>

The patient, a man in his 80s, did not have travel history or contact with a known COVID-19 case. He remains hospitalized in isolation. Shasta County tests: 6 positive, 230 negative.</li>

We have also streamlined entrance to the hospital to only Main Entrance and our no visitor policy remains in place. We continue to monitor supplies and plan for any potential surge, including the setup of our Negative Pressure Unit that was completed last week. Current patients at Shasta Regional Medical Group may make appointments utilizing our Tele-Medicine system by calling 530-605-4260.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.shastahealth.org/covid19" target="_blank"><strong>Shasta Community Health Center</strong></a></strong><strong>:</strong> All campuses are open including Shasta Lake City and Anderson. We have closed all of our dental facilities except for dental emergencies for our patients at our downtown location in the Shasta College Health Sciences complex. We continue to screen all patients entering our facilities and have established a secondary screening facility at our main campus at 1035 Placer Street. We continue to make plans for a surge of patients with respiratory needs. We have moved many more of our visits (and we routinely do over 500 a day) to telephonic where we can. We are holding steady on personal protective equipment, watching our inventory and burn rate but looking for more items as an edge against a large surge of patients later on. We await the Abbott Labs-announced COVID point of care test kits that promise a positive result in 5 minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes. We await information on its sensitivities, however.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.redding-rancheria.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Redding Rancheria Tribal Health Center</strong></a></strong><strong>:</strong> We have been screening all patients and staff at all three health campuses since March 10. We are currently running two shifts, each shift is working 1 week on and having 1 week off in an effort to conserve staff, and keep them healthy both physically and emotionally. We have been doing phone call visits between providers and patients and will be allowing patients to schedule virtual visits with their providers starting Monday. We have an ample supply of personal protective equipment, but are running low on test kits. Our urgent care at Churn Creek Health Care is still operating 7 days a week with 2 doctors per day.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.mayersmemorial.com/getpage.php?name=Coronavirus_Information" target="_blank"><strong>Mayers Memorial Hospital District</strong></a></strong><strong>:</strong> We began a no-visitor policy on March 6, primarily because of our 90 skilled nursing residents. We have suspended all communal activities in the skilled nursing facility as of March 27. Our social workers and activities department are working to keep avenues of communication open to families and provide alternate activities for the residents. Mayers started screening all employees on March 16 and has a policy in place for screening and employee health. We continue to utilize only one entrance to our facility. We are able to use an isolation trailer to screen, evaluate and collect test specimens on patients if deemed necessary. Collaboration continues with Shasta Regional Medical Center and Mercy on our surge planning, close monitoring of inventory and burn rate of personal protective equipment and supporting our valuable workforce. Mayers has also been active in helping our community with the Groceries to Go program.</li>
